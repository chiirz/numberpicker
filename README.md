### Few notes on resources

* The number picker preference uses a few attributes defined in the res/values/attrs.xml file.

* In the number picker preference Java class it references the namespace defined in the attrs.xml file.

* You'll notice in the res/xml/preferences.xml file in the top level element there's a namespace defined to allow easy use
of properties to set max range and min range as well as the default value.
